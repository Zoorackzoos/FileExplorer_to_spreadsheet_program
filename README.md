## goal
anytime I need to do a large amount of computer labor to manage files, like idk sims 4 mods or something i'll make a module here. a deep internet lurker might find it and it will be useful to them.  
Also.... make spreadsheets out of files i have on my computer. 
  
Out of ethical empathy i should tell you i used GPT for some of these modules.  
  
## scan_videos.py documentation
### what is scan_videos.py
input =  
directory of where you want the scanning for videos to start  
directory & file name of where you want to save the .csv file that is the output
  
output =  
a .csv file you can plug into any spreadsheet program & view
  
currently this only shows you the
* title
* date the video was downloaded
* path on your computer

### thoughts on scan_videos.py
i realized I had no reason to make GPT make this.  
i thought it would give me more scope on what i should download so i correctly participate in a YouTube boycott but both this program and that movement i didn't really fully understand or care for.

### args for scan_videos.py in the terminal
ex =  
python video_indexer.py "C:/Your/Video/Folder/Path" "C:/Your/OutputPath/filename.csv"

this hasn't been verfied

# wars against the machine
## wars - scan_videos.py
there's just a mountain of methods I do not know. Idk how the hell i'm going to know where to look if i were asked to compose something myself. because it's one thing to know where the method's documentation is or where the good documentation is. and it's another to properly use it. How? 
  
the only thing i recognized is the "with open" structure.  
i should document that because i used that in a homework once. Maybe it's in my capstone.
